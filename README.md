# idealista_renting
## Objective:

Thanks to Idealista API,  a dataset with information for many apartments in a certain area can be downloaded.

Using this dataset, this project aims to build a renting price prediction model. 

The use case is that once the user (myself, since I am looking right now for accommodation) has selected a few apartments in which he is interested. He passes them through the model, that will give an estimated price for the property. This price can be compared with the real one to detect bargains or overpriced properties.
